Key Features in Your Code
Responsive Design:

The inclusion of the viewport meta tag ensures the website adjusts to different screen sizes.
Flexbox (display: flex) in navigation and product grids makes the layout adaptive.
Interactive Navigation:

Tabs use onclick events to show and hide content dynamically, maintaining a single-page experience.
Well-Styled Components:

CSS is used effectively for styling elements like the header, navigation, product cards, and buttons.
Shadows and hover effects (:hover) enhance the user experience.
Informative Content:

Each section (e.g., "Home," "About Us") is rich with relevant and engaging text, guiding users through the website's purpose and features.
Suggestions for Improvement
Dynamic Cart Functionality:

Currently, the "Add to Cart" button triggers a basic addToCart function. Implement logic to manage cart items dynamically using JavaScript or a backend framework.
Consistent Image Usage:

Ensure all product images (e.g., laptop.jpg, mobile.jpg) are available in the correct directory, or use placeholder images to avoid broken links.
SEO Enhancements:

Add meta tags for description, keywords, and author to improve search engine visibility.
Accessibility:

Add alt text for all images to make the site accessible for screen readers.
Use ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance navigation for users with disabilities.
Error Handling:

Wrap onclick events in try-catch blocks to handle any unexpected errors.
Validate form inputs in the "Contact Us" section.
Modular CSS:

Consider splitting your CSS into separate files or using a preprocessor like SASS for better maintainability.
External Links for CSS/JS Libraries:

Include external libraries like Bootstrap or Font Awesome for extended functionality and consistent styling.
Footer Content:

Enhance the footer with additional links (e.g., privacy policy, terms of service) and social media icons.
